# another-vagrant-openstack

### Overview.
A simple Vagrant setup for launching VMs in OpenStack.

##SETUP: Begin by installing the following:

- Clone the bootstrap repo: **git clone ssh://<user>@<url-for-git-repo>/<project-name>
- Supported on MacOS 10.9 or later.
- **Install** Vagrant: 1.6.5 or later - <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>
- **Install these Vagrant plugins**
- - vagrant-openstack-provider >=(0.7.1)
- - vagrant-reload
- - vagrant-host-shell

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-openstack-provider vagrant-vbox-snapshot

```
- **Install these Ruby gems:**

```
sudo gem install librarian-puppet-simple mustache
```
- **Install openstack client python-glanceclient:**

```
sudo easy_install python-glanceclient
```


####SETUP: 
- **Add your openrc file to this cloned repo** : Uses horizon to download a copy of your openrc
  file for one of your user/tenant combos that MUST NOT have the admin role.
  Place the openrc file within your cloned repo.
- **Add to your openrc file**: 
  Add: "export VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER=openstack‚Äù to your openrc file.
- **Source openrc** Source your openrc to enable the openstack provider.
  This will configure vagrant to start nodes using the openstack provider and
  allow you to verify instance status using the nova/neutron CLI.
  Only the horizon generated specific source of the openrc file has been tested
  and is known to contain all of the settings needed. Use others at your own
  risk. example: "source openrc"
